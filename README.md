# Logistic Regression for Binary Classification



This project implements a Logistic Regression model to classify tumors as **malignant** or **benign** using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## Workflow

1. **Dataset Selection:** Binary classification dataset with features and diagnosis label (`M` = 1, `B` = 0).
2. **Data Preparation:** Train/test split (80/20) and feature standardization with `StandardScaler`.
3. **Model Training:** Logistic Regression fitted with scaled training data.
4. **Evaluation:** Performance measured using confusion matrix, precision, recall, ROC-AUC, and ROC curve visualization.
5. **Threshold Tuning:** Custom classification thresholds explored; sigmoid function explained for probability outputs.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```
